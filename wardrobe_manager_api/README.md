REQUIREMENTS

Provide a RESTful web service with equivalent functionality as the Wardrobe Management web application with GUI.

IMPLEMENTATION

The implemented Wardrobe Management API web service is a Catalyst application built in the following environment:

Ubuntu 14.04, x86_64
Perl v5.18.2
Catalyst 5.09
MySQ: 5.5

The application requires a couple of additional Perl modules:

    Catalyst::Controller::REST
    Lingua::EN::Inflect
    Text::CSV::Auto

Required modules are listed in Makefile.PL and will be installed by running 
    perl Makefile.PL

INSTALLATION

Codebase:

    From tarball:
        unpack the tarball: tar zxvf wardrobe_manager_api.tar.gz

    From github (if available):
        git clone git://github.com/tamarakaufler/wardrobe_manager_api.git

MySQL

    cd sql (on the same level as the README file)
    mysql -u root -p wardrobemanagerapi_user.sql
    mysql -u root -p wardrobemanagerapi.sql

    To import the provided test data, if desired:
        mysql -u root -p import_data.sql

NOTE

A GUI application and an API web service with equivalent functionality are running on http://178.62.10.94:3010 and http://178.62.10.94:3011 respectively.

DOCUMENTATION

    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/readme

    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/docs/clothing
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/docs/category
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/docs/outfit
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/docs/clothing_outfit

PROVIDED FUNCTIONALITY

The application provides partial functionality and has scope for improvement.

1) CRud for clothing/category/outfit ... search (by id and name) and outfit (tagging) so far
2) Retrieval of a list of clothes, their categories and associated outfits
3) Tagging of clothes(clothing_outfit)
4) clothing and categories can be created by uploading a CSV or JSON file. Format of the JSON file can be a hash or an array of hashes.

DESIGN

I took advantage of the boilerplate code offered by Catalyst and its base RESTful controller. There are two RESTful controllers: Api and Tag,
and one library module with helper functions.

CRud implementation is done through DBIC introspection, so the same code can be used for all entity types (clothing/category etc).
Retrieval of the clothings list uses a convenience Result Clothing instance method. 

The application supports upload of CSV and JSON files (curl -F option) and json content type for curl -d/--data/-T options.  

API calls:

sample upload files are in sample_files dir on the same lever as the README file

1) CRud for clothing/category/outfit ... search (by id and name) and creation so far

GET:
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing/id/3
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing/outfit/3
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing/name/iRun%20White%20Trainers
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing/name/%Trainers    (fuzzy search)
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing/name/Niceâ„¢%       (fuzzy search)
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/category/name/Shoes
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/outfit/id/3
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api/outfit

POST:
    curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Trousers"}'  http://localhost:3010/api/category
    curl -X POST -T tagging2.json  http://localhost:3010/tag/clothing

    Retrieval of a list of clothes, their categories and associated outfits
    curl -X GET  http://localhost:3010/api

    Tagging of clothes(clothing_outfit)
    curl -X POST -T tagging2.json  http://localhost:3010/tag/clothing 
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"clothing":"3", "outfit":"4"}'  http://localhost:3010/tag/clothing

    Clothing and categories can be created by uploading a CSV or JSON file. Format of the JSON file can be a hash
    or an array of hashes. The file extension should correspond to its content:        

        curl -X POST -F 'file=@clothing.csv'  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing
                                        or
        curl -X POST -F 'file=@clothing.csv'  http://localhost:3010/api/category
                                        or
        curl -X POST -F 'file=@clothing.json'  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing
                                        or
        curl -X POST -F 'file=@clothing.json'  http://localhost:3010/api/category

        curl -X POST -T 'clothing.csv'  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing
        curl -X POST -T 'clothing.json'  http://localhost:3010/api/category

        curl -X POST -F 'file=@incorrect_format.js'  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing
        curl -X POST -F 'file=@empty.csv'  http://localhost:3010/api/clothing

LIMITATIONS

1) No unit tests
2) Limited documentation

IMPROVEMENTS 

1) Add crUD functionality (update/delete)
2) When creating new entities, use find and create separately rather than find_or_create and output only created entities
3) Write unit tests
4) Add authentication/authorization
5) Add caching to improve performace
6) Add more POD
7) Add versioning
8) Could have used Try::Tiny
